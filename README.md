# SpectrumAnalyser

This is part of the Lalalab exhibition of [IMAGINARY](https://lalalab.imaginary.org).
The exhibit can be used to analyse the live-spectrum of the microphone.

It is based on the [CindyJS](https://cindyjs.org)-framework.

## Installation

Just download everything and put in on a webserver and open `index.html`.

An [online version](https://raw.githack.com/CindyJS/SpectrumAnalyser/master/index.html) of this repository is served through githack.com.

For exhibits, it is recommended to use the [kiosk-browser](https://github.com/IMAGINARY/kiosk-browser) and [xbanish-hide](https://github.com/IMAGINARY/xbanish-hide) on a minified desktop environment such as [Openbox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page).


## Configuration

The applet requires a click before the CindyJS widget starts. On most browsers this is required before access to the the microphone is granted.
This behavior can be switched of by adding `?autostart=false` to the URL, i.e. opening the URL `index.html?autostart=false`.
